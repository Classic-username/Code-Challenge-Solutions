# Code-Challenge-Solutions

The purpose of this repo is to be committing daily to Github, but purposeful commits.

Apparently jobs check your github for green squares?

My daily commits will be solutions to code challenges on various sites.

I will include the URL to the challenge, and the solution code.

I write primarily in JavaScript and Python, but as I expand my knowledge of languages I will add and commit in more files.
